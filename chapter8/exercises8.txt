1.  It is inferior because if the type was changed, then in all occurances of the expression:
    sizeof(a) / sizeof(t)
    't' would need to be changed.

2.  To use a digit (char, eg: '1', '2', '3', etc.) as an array subscript, to 'scale' you must
    subtract '0'. The expression would be:
    a['1' - '0']
    that would get the first element as the ascii table depicts '1' as 49 and '0' as 48 hence being
    49 - 48 = 1

3.  The declaration would go as follows for c89:
    bool weekend[] = {true, false, false, false, false, false, false, true}

4.  The declaration would go as follows for c99:
    bool weekend[] = {[0] = true, [6] = true}

5.  Fibonacci sequence in 40 elements of an array:
	int fib[40] = {0}, x, y, z;
	x = 0, y = 1;
	for (int i = 0; i < (int) (sizeof(fib) / sizeof(fib[0])); i++)
	{
		fib[i] = x + y;
		z = x + y;
		x = y;
		y = z;
	}
