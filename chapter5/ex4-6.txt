4. (i < j) - (j < i)

5. It is legal, but it runs for any integer value.
    n is greater than or equal to 1: (n >= 1) evaluates to 1 which is less than 10 (1 <= 10)
    n is less than 1: (n >= 1) evaluates to 0 which is less than 10 (0 <= 10)
    
6. It is legal, but (n == 1-10) is actually (n == -9), so this is only true when n is -9
