1.                 p              q
    int a[] = {5, 15, 34, 54, 14, 2, 52, 72};
    int *p = &a[1], *q = &a[5];

    a) *(p+3)  is 54
    b) *(q-3)  is 34
    c) q-p     is 4
    d) p < q   is 1 - true
    e) *p < *q is 0 - false

2.  low, middle, high are pointers, low and high point to array elements, why isn't this legal?
    middle = (low + high) / 2;
    You can't add pointers together, only can minus them. To fix:

	int n = 7;
	high = &a[n];
	middle = high - (n / 2);
