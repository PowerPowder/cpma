1.  Can the following be in the same program and work?
    struct { int x, y; } x;
    struct { int x, y; } y;

    Yes, they are legal on an individual basis, they are both separate despite the same members.
    They can both be in the same program too.

2.  a) Declare a struct for c1, c2, c3 which have real and imaginary type of doubles:
        struct {
            double real;
            double imaginary;
        } c1, c2, c3;
    b) Modify (a) for c1 to have 0.0 and 1.0, c2 to have 1.0 and 0.0, c3 not initialised:
        struct {
            double real;
            double imaginary;
        } c1 = {0.0, 1.0}, c2 = {1.0, 0.0}, c3;
    c) Write statements to copy c2 into c1:
        c1.real = c2.real;
        c2.imaginary = c2.imaginary;

        or it can be done as:
        c1 = c2;
    d) Write statements that add the members in c1 and c2, store them in c3:
        c3.real = c1.real + c2.real; 
        c3.imaginary = c1.imaginary + c2.imaginary;
