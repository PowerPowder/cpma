1.  List all variable and parameter names visibile in that scope
    a) f function: a, b, c
    b) g function: a, d
    c) block with e: a, d, e
    d) main function: a, f

2.  List all variable and parameter names visibile in that scope
    a) f function: b (in f, external variable b is hidden), c, d
    b) g function: b, c (in g, external variable c is hidden), a
    c) block with a and d: a, d, c (in g, external variable c is hidden), b
    d) main function: b, c (in main, external variable c is hidden), d

3.  One external, one local, one as a parameter, depending on if statements, for loops, switch
    statements all can have one each.
