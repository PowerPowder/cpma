1.  i is a var, p is a pointer to i, which are aliases for i:
    a) *p is an alias
    b) &p is not an alias
    c) *&p is not an alias
    d) &*p is not an alias
    e) *i is not an alias
    f) &i is not an alias
    g) *&i is an alias
    h) &*i is not an alias

2.  If i is an int variable and p and q are pointers to int, which of the following assignments are legal?
    a) p = i;       legal
    b) *p = &i;     legal
    c) &p = q;      illegal
    d) p = &q;      legal
    e) p = *&q;     legal
    f) p = q;       legal
    g) p = *q;      legal
    h) *p = q;      legal
    i) *p = *q;     legal
